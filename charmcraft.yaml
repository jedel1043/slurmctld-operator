  Slurmctld, the central management daemon of Slurm.
description: |
  This charm provides slurmctld, munged, and the bindings to other utilities
  that make lifecycle operations a breeze.

  slurmctld is the central management daemon of SLURM. It monitors all other
  SLURM daemons and resources, accepts work (jobs), and allocates resources
  to those jobs.  Given the critical functionality of slurmctld, there may be
  a backup server to assume these functions in the event that the primary
  server fails.

  options:
    custom-slurm-repo:
      type: string
      default: ""
      description: >
        Use a custom repository for Slurm installation.
  
        This can be set to the Organization's local mirror/cache of packages and
        supersedes the Omnivector repositories. Alternatively, it can be used to
        track a `testing` Slurm version, e.g. by setting to
        `ppa:omnivector/osd-testing`.
  
        Note: The configuration `custom-slurm-repo` must be set *before*
        deploying the units. Changing this value after deploying the units will
        not reinstall Slurm.
    cluster-name:
      type: string
      default: osd-cluster
      description: >
        Name to be recorded in database for jobs from this cluster.
  
        This is important if a single database is used to record information from
        multiple Slurm-managed clusters.
    default-partition:
      type: string
      default: ""
      description: >
        Default Slurm partition. This is only used if defined, and must match an
        existing partition.
    custom-config:
      type: string
      default: ""
      description: >
        User supplied Slurm configuration.
  
        This value supplements the charm supplied `slurm.conf` that is used for
        Slurm Controller and Compute nodes.
  
        Example usage:
        $ juju config slurmcltd custom-config="FirstJobId=1234"
    proctrack-type:
      type: string
      default: proctrack/cgroup
      description: >
        Identifies the plugin to be used for process tracking on a job step
        basis.
    cgroup-config:
      type: string
      default: |
        CgroupAutomount=yes
        ConstrainCores=yes
      description: >
        Configuration content for `cgroup.conf`.
  
    health-check-params:
      default: ""
      type: string
      description: >
        Extra parameters for NHC command.
  
        This option can be used to customize how NHC is called, e.g. to send an
        e-mail to an admin when NHC detects an error set this value to
        `-M admin@domain.com`.
    health-check-interval:
      default: 600
      type: int
      description: Interval in seconds between executions of the Health Check.
    health-check-state:
      default: "ANY,CYCLE"
      type: string
      description: Only run the Health Check on nodes in this state.
  
    acct-gather-frequency:
      type: string
      default: "task=30"
      description: >
        Accounting and profiling sampling intervals for the acct_gather plugins.
  
        Note: A value of `0` disables the periodic sampling. In this case, the
        accounting information is collected when the job terminates.
  
        Example usage:
        $ juju config slurmcltd acct-gather-frequency="task=30,network=30"
    acct-gather-custom:
      type: string
      default: ""
      description: >
        User supplied `acct_gather.conf` configuration.
  
        This value supplements the charm supplied `acct_gather.conf` file that is
        used for configuring the acct_gather plugins.

actions:
  show-current-config:
    description: >
      Display the currently used `slurm.conf`.
  
      Note: This file only exists in `slurmctld` charm and is automatically
      distributed to all compute nodes by Slurm.
  
      Example usage:
      $ juju run-action slurmctld/leader --format=json --wait | jq .[].results.slurm.conf | xargs -I % -0 python3 -c 'print(%)'
  drain:
    description: >
      Drain specified nodes.
  
      Example usage:
      $ juju run-action slurmctld/leader drain nodename=node-[1,2] reason="Updating kernel"
    params:
      nodename:
        type: string
        description: The nodes to drain, using the Slurm format, e.g. `node-[1,2]`.
      reason:
        type: string
        description: Reason to drain the nodes.
    required:
      - nodename
      - reason
  resume:
    description: >
      Resume specified nodes.
  
      Note: Newly added nodes will remain in the `down` state until configured,
      with the `node-configured` action.
  
      Example usage: $ juju run-action slurmctld/leader resume nodename=node-[1,2]
    params:
      nodename:
        type: string
        description: >
          The nodes to resume, using the Slurm format, e.g. `node-[1,2]`.
    required:
      - nodename
